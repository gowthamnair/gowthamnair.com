<p>Having worked with multiple startups/SMBs across diverse industries, I have been lucky enough to distill and apply a core set of transferable analytical skills wherever I go. 
 I strongly believe in asking the right questions and breaking down problems to fundamentals, before creating a solution. 
  I've worked in multiple teams, as a leader and a follower and believe in investing in people, not solely their work.
Currently I'm pursuing my Masters in Big Data and Analytics and MBA with IE University. I also freelance consult with businesses, helping them leverage their data to its full potential.
Avid trekker, amateur photographer and recent convert into the world of audiobooks. </p>
